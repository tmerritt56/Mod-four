# Mod-four

## Description
-   I created this to be a quiz on coding topics. 
-  Once you hit the start button the timer will start. 
- Once you answer a question, you will be directed to the next one. 
- If you get the answer wrong you will see that time will be subtracted from the clock. 
- Once you have either answered all the questions or the time has run out you will be able to save your score and initials. 
- The purpose of this is to test new coders and their skills via a quiz.
